I am an Instructional Assistant in the Department of Political Science at the University of Chicago, where I received my MA in 2023. I am interested in the temporal sequence of democratic backsliding, quantitative methods, and the politics of presidential term limits. My thesis examined which democratic institutions were frequently undermined early and late in declining democracies with term limits. Merging a new dataset of term limit evaders with existing indicators of democratic decline, it considers how term limits, by constraining executive tenure, might incentivize would-be autocrats to dismantle some democratic institutions before others. An ongoing project studies the effectiveness of unamendable term limit provisions.  

I am dedicated to the open source framework, and most of my projects can be found on my {{< icon name="github" pack="fab" >}}[Github](https://github.com/davidicrabtree).
