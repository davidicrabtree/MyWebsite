I am a Political Science student at the University of Chicago, where I will receive my MA in 2023. My research interests are broadly in the domain of democratic erosion, especially in Latin America. My thesis project examines how that presidents try to stay in power longer than the limits in their constitutions permit. I have two BAs in Political Science and International Affairs from East Tennessee State University, where I graduated summa cum laude in 2022. As an undergraduate, I published two articles hypothesizing the role of COVID-19 in shaping welfare attitudes in the United States.    

My current work combines my substantive interests in comparative politics with my background in quantitative methods. I am dedicated to the open source framework, and most of my projects can be found on my {{< icon name="github" pack="fab" >}}[Github](https://github.com/davidicrabtree).
