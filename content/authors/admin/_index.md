I am a Political Science student at the University of Chicago, where I will receive my MA in 2023. My research interests are in comparative political development and the economic factors of democratization. I have two BAs in Political Science and International Affairs from East Tennessee State University, where I graduated summa cum laude in 2022.  

Before discovering finding my place in comparative politics, I co-authored manuscripts related to the perception of welfare recipients in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. This work is currently under review in academic journals.  

In my free time, I tutor research methodology and statistics for students of political science, psychology, sociology, and other social science disciplines. My tutoring background spans the course of two years, and to this day I enjoy sharing my passion for data science with other driven academics.
