My tutoring experience spans two years of working with undergraduate and graduate students in political science, psychology, sociology, and other social science disciplines. I primarily work with academics who want to expand their understanding of quantitative research methodology, usually in R. In Summer 2022, I taught a training program for applied statistics in R which covered t-tests, linear regression, chi-squared models, proportion testing, and ANOVAs. 

I have also tutored on substantive topics within political science, and my introductory lessons within Comparative Politics and International Relations are available below. 

Beyond my work with students at ETSU, I am a registered tutor on [Wyzant](https://www.wyzant.com/Tutors/davidic), where I currently have a five-star rating.

> I have been meeting with David to get support in understanding advanced statistics using R. Not only does he understand the theoretical and mathematical backdrop of statistical testing, but he can explain this all with ease and patience. His background in the social sciences has been especially beneficial for my questions; he understands the logic behind relationships. If I was the chair of an undergraduate statistics program, I would hire him to teach a course to new students. I would highly recommend David to anyone who needs support in understanding statistics, without reservation!
