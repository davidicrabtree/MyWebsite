# Realism
An International Relations Theory

## When do states go to war?

{{% fragment %}} Realism offers answers to these questions. It is one framework for predicting when states will go to war, and it explains why states are so inherently aggressive. {{% /fragment %}}

## Five Core Assumptions of Realism
##### According to John Mearsheimer

<span style="font-size: 35px">  

1. The international system is anarchic
1. States possess some inherent military capability
1. One state can't know another state's intentions
1. The primary goal of states is survival
1. States are rational actors

### Assumption 1: Anarchy
<span style="font-size: 25px">  

- Anarchy refers to the structure of the international system
  - When IR scholars refer to "anarchy," they do not mean chaos or disorder
  - States have *no higher authority to appeal to during crisis.* No government over governments
  
- 911 Scenario

- Anarchy creates incentive for distrust and self-help
  - "God helps states that help themselves." - John Mearsheimer

### Assumption 2: Offensive Military Capabilities  
<span style="font-size: 25px">  

- All states possess _some_ military capability  

- Thus, by virtue of existing, a state in the international system poses a threat to other states via its military.  

- Because of this, fear is a characteristic of life in the international system. States do and should fear the capabilities of other states, according to realists.  
  - To do otherwise is naive.
  - Today's allies are tomorrow's enemies, and vice-versa.

### Assumption 3: Unknown Intentions

<span style="font-size: 25px">   

- A state can never be sure that another state will not use its military offensively.  
  - Specifically highlights the uncertain nature of alliances
  - Consider Sparta in the Melian Dialogue: Why did they not help their ally, the Melians?  
  
- Does not necessarily mean all states are aggressive - the point is, it's impossible to *know.* 

- Essentially, assumption 2 is all states have aggressive _capacity_, and assumption 3 pertains to the unknowability of aggressive _intention_.

- Result: States should prepare for the worst.

### Assumption 4: Survival is the Primary Goal of States

<span style="font-size: 25px"> 

- The emphasis here is that - before *ANYTHING* else - states are concerned about survival. 
  - Implications: Tertiary motives like ideology, alliances, trade, international commitments, etc. are only important _after_ a state's survival is secured. Survival is *always* first. 
  - Consider Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, applied to states.
  
- Joseph Stalin: "We can and must build socialism. But in order to do so we first of all ahve to exist." 

---

## Assumption 5: States are Rational Actors

<span style="font-size: 25px"> 

- Emphasis here is that states are _aware_ of both the implications of their own actions *and* (more to the point) the implications of other states' actions and preferences.  

- Example: If a state builds up its military, other states may grow nervous due to the implications for their own security.
