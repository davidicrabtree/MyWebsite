Why do states go to war? When should we expect conflict? Does the international system allow for states to peacefully co-exist?  

In this lecture, we explore the theoretical perspective of realism and its answers to these questions. 

Recommended Readings:
- Chapter 2 from _The Tragedy of Great Power Politics_, by John Mearsheimer  
- _The Melian Dialogue_, from _The Pelopponesian War_, by Thucydides
