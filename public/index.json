My thesis examined which democratic institutions were frequently undermined early and late in declining democracies with term limits. Merging a new dataset of term limit evaders with existing indicators of democratic decline, it considers how term limits, by constraining executive tenure, might incentivize would-be autocrats to dismantle some democratic institutions before others. An ongoing project studies the effectiveness of unamendable term limit provisions.\nI am dedicated to the open source framework, and most of my projects can be found on my Github.\nDownload my CV.\n","date":1672963200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1672963200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am an Instructional Assistant in the Department of Political Science at the University of Chicago, where I received my MA in 2023.

What common themes did you notice in the Melian Dialogue and the Munich Conference? Why do you think Athens decided to invade Melos? Why do you think Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia after agreeing not to? Realism offers answers to these questions. It is one framework for predicting when states will go to war, and it explains why states are so inherently aggressive. Five Core Assumptions of Realism According to John Mearsheimer The international system is anarchic States possess some inherent military capability One state can’t know another state’s intentions The primary goal of states is survival States are rational actors Assumption 1: Anarchy Anarchy refers to the structure of the international system\nWhen IR scholars refer to “anarchy,” they do not mean chaos or disorder States have no higher authority to appeal to during crisis. No government over governments 911 Scenario\nAnarchy creates incentive for distrust and self-help\n“God helps states that help themselves.” - John Mearsheimer Assumption 2: Offensive Military Capabilities All states possess some military capability\nThus, by virtue of existing, a state in the international system poses a threat to other states via its military.\nBecause of this, fear is a characteristic of life in the international system. States do and should fear the capabilities of other states, according to realists.\nTo do otherwise is naive. Today’s allies are tomorrow’s enemies, and vice-versa. Assumption 3: Unknown Intentions A state can never be sure that another state will not use its military offensively.\nSpecifically highlights the uncertain nature of alliances Consider Sparta in the Melian Dialogue: Why did they not help their ally, the Melians? Does not necessarily mean all states are aggressive - the point is, it’s impossible to know.\nEssentially, assumption 2 is all states have aggressive capacity, and assumption 3 pertains to the unknowability of aggressive intention.\nResult: States should prepare for the worst.\nAssumption 4: Survival is the Primary Goal of States The emphasis here is that - before ANYTHING else - states are concerned about survival.\nImplications: Tertiary motives like ideology, alliances, trade, international commitments, etc. are only important after a state’s survival is secured. Survival is always first. Consider Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, applied to states. Joseph Stalin: “We can and must build socialism. But in order to do so we first of all ahve to exist.”\nAssumption 5: States are Rational Actors Emphasis here is that states are aware of both the implications of their own actions and (more to the point) the implications of other states’ actions and preferences.\nExample: If a state builds up its military, other states may grow nervous due to the implications for their own security.\nThree Predictions from Realist Assumptions Fear Self-Help Power Maximization ","date":1656892800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656892800,"objectID":"f768eb137fda4d0cc51c4f59c8ffa965","permalink":"https://davidicrabtree.com/slides/realism/","publishdate":"2022-07-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/slides/realism/","section":"slides","summary":"An introduction to using Wowchemy's Slides feature.","tags":["IR Theory"],"title":"Realism","type":"slides"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Why do states go to war?

In this quest, she works alongside theoretical physicist and future husband Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) after they are recruited by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) of the U.S. military.\nThe film’s metaphors range in their explicitness from subtle to very direct, and as such the movie has spawned no short list of critical reviews (including this one) which are eager to expand upon ideas that director Denis Villeneuve weaved seamlessly together into a single 116 minute narrative. While most of the film’s underlying meaning pushes audiences to consider the transience of life and the power of language, the movie also has clear political metaphors, and it offers a message to realist theorists of international relations: you assume too much.\nWhen the aliens first arrive, we are shown the breakdown of human society: protests in the streets of Washington, violence in the capital of Venezuela, and public schools and universities rendered vacant. The media is hyper-fixated on the reticent government response, and the government for its part remains tight-lipped in its interactions with the public. When Louise is recruited by the U.S. Army, she is told very directly that her (and the government’s) top priority is to figure out who these aliens are and what they want.\nImage Here At first glance, this response may seem entirely rational given what we do know about these potential invaders: the aliens look like octopi-meets tree root-meets gigantic human hand, they sound like whales, and they fly around in massive metal bean-pods. What could be more terrifying? Perhaps, as some of the extremist media commentators in the film suggested, the U.S. government should act first to secure its citizens safety and ask questions later.\nBut this line of thinking is seriously flawed, and more than that - it poignantly represents the dangers of humanity’s tendency for xenophobia, suspicion, and fear in light of the unknown intentions of foreign actors. Realists argue that this suspicion in the international arena is not only justified but necessary, because they assume humans (and thereby states, which are a human social construction) are, above all else, concerned with survival, relative gains in power, and the uncertainty of an anarchic international system. This line of thinking appears to have been persuasive to the top U.S. decision-makers in the film, who decide to cut all communications with other nations once they learn the aliens want to “offer” humanity a “weapon.”\nImage Here By this point in the film, the plot has really picked up pace, and I did not really think much about this decision the first time I watched it. Of course - the U.S. should be fearful and suspicious if a technologically advanced race of aliens wants to bring a weapon to Earth, a planet with no single political leader and an international system based on anarchy. It would be foolhardy to risk talking to other suspicious, self-interested states, them figuring out about this weapon, and everyone potentially triggering a war over who gets to control it. Right?\n. . . Not really. As Alexander Wendt describes in his aptly named 1992 article, “Anarchy is what States Make of it,” anarchy is not a structural characteristic of an unchangeable international landscape. Rather, it is a function of human interaction, socially contrived assumptions, and agreed-upon patterns of acceptable behavior. At the end of his article, Wendt describes how our interactions with a hypothetical alien civilization would be determined by a process of signaling, interpreting, and responding until we had constructed an identity for the aliens based on patterns of perceived behavior.\nThis is exactly what happens in the first half of Arrival, with every nation (including trigger-happy China) at least making some effort to understand the aliens’ intentions and communicate with each other before acting aggressively to secure their own survival. This example clearly illustrates the socially constructed nature of anarchy: put in an extreme situation with unknown actors, states opened communications channels with both each other and the potential invaders in order to determine their intentions and reduce uncertainty.\nImportantly, this interpretation in the beginning of the film did not ignore humanity’s predisposition towards fear - it embraced it. By the second half of the movie, after the aliens indicate that their purpose is to “offer weapon,” humanity’s defining traits and cynical assumptions start to show through. As prospects grow increasingly dim for peace, the contrast between the constructivist mindset and the realist mindset can best be seen through Louise’s interactions with U.S. …","date":1645409594,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645409594,"objectID":"fda58ee9a781985cb0cd948ab344280c","permalink":"https://davidicrabtree.com/blog/arrival/","publishdate":"2022-02-20T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/blog/arrival/","section":"blog","summary":"If aliens landed on Earth tomorrow, what would humanity do?
